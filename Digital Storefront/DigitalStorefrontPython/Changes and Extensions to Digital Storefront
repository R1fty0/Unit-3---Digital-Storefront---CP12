Digital Storefront Extensions and Requirements:

- Adding all text to classes (one class for each menu).
- The option to return any item with 1 minute of purchase
- A Night Market that randomly appears where all items have a randomly generated discount.
- Adding an Admin account with a unique password, which allows them to add new items to the store, edit prices and view sales of previous items.
- Adding an option to select what country and currency the user is in, and having prices adjust accordingly.


Tier 1:
    Add exception handling to all relevant menus to prevent the user from breaking cod logic

    Add a new class of Buyable items to the store and pre-populate the store with at least 5 unique items in the categories inventory.
    Integrate your new buyable class into the menus and data management for your shopping cart.

Tier 2 & 3:
    Improve the Store class’ viewCatalog() method to provide the user a menu to choose which sub-catalog they want to view individually.
    Advanced: Provide the user another menu to choose which specific item they want to view more details about individually.

    Improve the reviewMyStuff() method, which pulls data from the list that contains all of the items you have bought, to contain a lot more functionality. Instead of just reporting everything the user has bought all at once, provide a more customized experience that gives the user more choice and information when reviewing their stuff.
    Hint: You may need to adjust how the user’s bought items are stored and tracked to provide access to certain information.
    Advanced: Create the menuing needed for the user to view any detail of every item they own. Hint: Use methods to create sub-menus for categories of things.

    Improve the StoreInventory class in the following ways:
    Instead of just removing bought items completely, create a separate database to keep track of items that have been sold (give it a memory).
    Advanced: Provide the user with the ability to viewRecentPurchases(), which should report the 3 (or fewer) most recent items they bought in the store. Hint: you will need to add content to the Store class’ menu to give the user access to this tool.
